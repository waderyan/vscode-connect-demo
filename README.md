# React / Node Todo Demo

This demo shows the core functionality of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
for Build 2016 session workshop.

## Getting Started

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-sample.git

# navigate to repo
cd react-todo

# install deps
npm install
```

**Backend**

```bash
# Run in terminal
npm run server
```

Debug in Visual Studio Code with <kbd>f5</kbd>

**Frontend**

```bash
# run in terminal
npm run dev
```

Run from Visual Studio Code by executing command (with <kbd>f1</kbd> to open command palette) 
`Run Task` and selecting `dev`.

**Database**

No configuration should be necessary necessary. Data backend is simply a json file called `todos.json` in `data/`.
If you run into any issues make sure `todos.json` has the following inside before starting the 
server. This will become more robust overtime.

```json
{
    "todos": []
}
```

## Not meant for production

There are a couple of issues to fix before this code base should
be used as a model for a production ready application.

* Swap out the file based data model for a real data backend.
* Replace webpack dev server with an application server or serve up the app with the Node server.
